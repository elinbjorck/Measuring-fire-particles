# Measure particles from private fireplaces

## Background
This is a project done for the course projects in e,bedded systems (COURSECODE) at linneaus university. The goal of the project is to build a device that can be placed outside and measure the air quality. Since the idea is to measure emissions specificaly from wood burning, the device will also measure temperature. Temperature is assumed to be an indication of when people are likely to use their fireplace.
